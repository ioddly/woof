x figure out if/then/else
x fibonacci numbers
x negative numbers
- write basic prelude
- variables
- local variables

  how do to this : square { x } x x * ; 
  where do local variable definitions live?
  what does referencing a local variable do?

  { x }
  // this causes a word to be defined shadowing
  // locals are hidden after word definition closes. (tbd how?)
  // add an additional stack for locals
  { x } 
  // x is defined as a word that references a particular offset on the locals stack
  // so { x y z }

  // } finds all locals, adds code to move things from data stack to locals stack
  // ; is extended to clean up locals

  // also we don't necessarily need cleanup -- we know when we're crossing function boundaries,
  // and can cleanup ourselves.

  // i think this will work!



- better error reporting 
- switch memory addresses to relative to forth, and only allow references to into forth
- stack traces
- safer C function calls
- loops of some kind
- console game of life
- gfx bindings
- graphical game of life
- optimization
-- a pretty simple optimization would be to inline a lot of c words like arithmetic as opcodes
- a less simple optimization would be to compile to machine code, but still fairly easy compared to writing one for a high level language

x implement definition of C++ words
x basic calling
x basic calling from within forth
x allow user defined forth words
- figure out if/then/else
-- basic idea, similar to traditional forths but rather than emitting another word "0branch" or whatever, you emit insns
-- so if leaves a jmp_if_zero, address (push address of code onto stack)
-- then overwrites address with actual code address
-- need to implement HERE
- write basic prelude
- better error reporting

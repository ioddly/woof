x implement definition of C++ words
x basic calling
x basic calling from within forth
x allow user defined forth words
- comments
- negative numbers
- figure out if/then/else
-- basic idea, similar to traditional forths but rather than emitting another word "0branch" or whatever, you emit insns
-- so if leaves a jmp_if_zero, address (push address of code onto stack)
-- then overwrites address with actual code address
-- need to implement HERE
- fibonacci numbers
- write basic prelude
- better error reporting (format some stuff, stack trace maybe)
- switch memory addresses to relative to forth, and only allow references to into forth
- 
- loops of some kind
- game of life
- gfx bindings
- console game of life
- graphical game of life
- figure out distribution?
- save forth images? (for cross-platform distribution maybe)
